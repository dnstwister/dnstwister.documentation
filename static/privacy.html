        <h2>The personal information we collect</h2>

        <h3>Email addresses and domain names</h3>
        <p>

            When you subscribe to receive email alerts for a domain, we
            store a mapping between your email address and that domain.

        </p>
        <p>

            We categorise and treat both the email address and domain name as
            "personal information" as either may be - for instance
            "john.doe@example.com" or "www.john-doe-blog.com".

        </p>


        <h3>Stripe customer details reference</h3>
        <p>

            To facilitate tracking of subscription state we keep a reference
            to your customer details held in Stripe. We use this reference to
            associate your subscription in <strong>dnstwister</strong> with
            the same in Stripe.

        </p>
        <p>

            We do not store any other Stripe-sourced information, but we do
            access a small set of Stripe-held information including
            non-sensitive card information (for instance the last four digits
            of your currently-configured card) to display on subscription
            management pages.

        </p>

        <h3>Logs</h3>
        <p>

            The logs generated by the <strong>dnstwister</strong> web
            application are archived in Papertrail. They will only be reviewed
            by the developer to troubleshoot production-site issues. These
            logs will never be shared with any other party.

        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>

            <strong>dnstwister</strong> does not set cookies, although one or
            more of the third-party services mentioned below may.

            If you unsubscribe from receiving email alerts for a domain, we

            and your customer, subscription and payment information from
            Stripe.
